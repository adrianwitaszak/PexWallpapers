# Welcome to PexWallpapers!

Hi! PexWallpapers is one of my current projects in Jetpack Compose. 
The app use Pexels.com image library to show pictures/wallpapers in the app. 
You can browse different categories or just use **Search** to find some beautiful wallpapers for your phone. 
If you add wallpapers to favourites than you can turn on **Auto Wallpaper Setter** in Settings, 
to have your phone wallpaper changed every specific period of time.
